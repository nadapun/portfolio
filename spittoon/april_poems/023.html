			<p><strong>Galleries</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Lucky enough to have been to galleries worldwide</p>
<p>Much of the art must be observed up close</p>
<p>However, this poem is about benches</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In galleries most people use the benches as respite</p>
<p>A tired mind, tired feet, a bored companion</p>
<p>Missing the true power of the bench</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, in galleries such as Rothko or Pollock &ndash; monsters</p>
<p>The bench is a source of competition</p>
<p>Everyone wants a seat absorbing giants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what of benches too far from the detail expected</p>
<p>These are my favorite benches &ndash; cut off</p>
<p>It is not here I rest and clear my mind...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I observe &ndash; space and form, movement and calm, energy</p>
<p>The passage of people, some too concerned</p>
<p>Seeing my reverence &ndash; ask if they paid theirs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love museum benches for the mundane respect they pay</p>
<p>But I love wild benches all the more &ndash; rabid</p>
<p>Sitting alone pondering on a museum bench is one thing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is a gallery littered with places to observe</p>
<p>And so, I shall, sketchbook at hand and a pen</p>
<p>I draw statues and ideas and people and skies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, this is an ode to benches, for, without them, I ask</p>
<p>Would we have galleries and art - reflection?</p>
<p>Would we have time for respite and pause?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my grandiose ideations, my convoluted machinations</p>
<p>Benches give me calm and public invisibility</p>
<p>An artist sitting and thinking without responsibility</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Praise to the mighty bench &ndash; champion of respite and rest</p>
<p>But so much more &ndash; forum, sanctuary, sight</p>
<p>Build benches, build monuments of pause</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bench &ndash; the hill I&rsquo;ll die on? &ndash; my architectural cause?</p>
