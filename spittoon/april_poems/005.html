			<p><strong>My City</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There was nowhere else I could end up</p>
<p>Sure, it was more chance than anything</p>
<p>But from Big Sky to 天府 makes sense</p>
<p>And Andy and 安迪 have the same ring</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the frozen plains of Montana</p>
<p>Bounced around not stirring up too much</p>
<p>A few broken bones &ndash; a lot of stories</p>
<p>Fountain diving, park wrestling, and such</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this town-kid, country-kid cowboy</p>
<p>Sits up on the forty-third floor</p>
<p>Settled into a view as far as he can see</p>
<p>The city cascades &ndash; he wants nothing more</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was nowhere else I could end up</p>
<p>The food, the vibes, the people, the stride</p>
<p>It all feels so comfortable to me</p>
<p>Allowing me to be just along for the ride</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have a state and a city</p>
<p>Pride in each &ndash; not lost, not empty</p>
<p>A town-kid cowboy on the 43<sup>rd</sup> floor</p>
<p>Waxing poetic about Chengdu and MT</p>
