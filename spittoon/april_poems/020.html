			<p><strong>Open/close</strong><br /> <br /> I open to the world and then have to close.</p>
<p>I have always hated the phrase, &ldquo;you think too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t hate much in this world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What, I hear is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stop being so fully yourself.&nbsp; We feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t meet you where you are.<br /> <br /> </em>So I close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know we all guard ourselves, but why these closures?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we talk in layers and nuance and metaphor?</p>
<p>And can I analyze multiple angles without that bite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You think too much &ndash; you care too much</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let me know you&rsquo;re tired or it&rsquo;s not a good time</p>
<p>Ask if we can talk about something lighter or...</p>
<p>Even just ask to sit in silence for a moment or two</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This I understand - this is communication</p>
<p>This I can work with and follow and still be me</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t cut down who I am &ndash; how I see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You think too much &ndash; you care too much</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>How could I do anything but close down<br /> <br /> They say systems should be open for extension</p>
<p>But closed for modification &ndash; open yet closed</p>
<p>Are we not systems?&nbsp; Seems a SOLID practice to me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me extend, bounce, explore&mdash;</p>
<p>Without the threat of being written over</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attempting to change you</p>
<p>And so respect me enough to do the same <br /> <br /> <em>You think too much &ndash; you care too much</em></p>
<p><em><br /> </em>No, I don&rsquo;t</p>
