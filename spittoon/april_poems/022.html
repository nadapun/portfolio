			<p><strong>Why I Absolutely Deserve You</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sunlight wakes me</p>
<p>You beside me &ndash; aware yet?</p>
<p>I lie awhile &ndash; to myself</p>
<p>I absolutely deserve you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twisted sheets &ndash; lack of sleep</p>
<p>A story of a night I shouldn't tell</p>
<p>And here we are wrapped together</p>
<p>With what conviction, I know not</p>
<p>I pull myself up - slippers on</p>
<p>Brush my teeth - make breakfast</p>
<p>I wonder if I really deserve you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You salter in - <em>back to bed?</em></p>
<p>But, today I need to be a person</p>
<p>I made breakfast instead?</p>
<p>Your weight on my shoulders</p>
<p>A presence I accept with grace</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Some more time with me in bed</em></p>
<p><em>Today can wait - What's the harm?</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right - had our fun - rest now</p>
<p>Back in bed - not setting alarms</p>
<p>I absolutely deserve you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wake with a start - check the clock</p>
<p>Half the day gone - I had plans</p>
<p>I almost forget you're there but then</p>
<p>The day's gone, stay here, you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>Did you or I come to this conclusion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to shower and at least</p>
<p>Conquer one task - one beast</p>
<p>Your arms hold me down - <em>no</em></p>
<p>I welcome the embrace - the excuse</p>
<p>I need you - a reason to stay</p>
<p>The sins of last night belayed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same sun that woke me falls</p>
<p>And I have done nothing but</p>
<p>Lay with you, your poignant thoughts</p>
<p>Your weight - your reasons to stay</p>
<p>I absolutely deserve you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We fall asleep having done nothing</p>
<p>And maybe that's okay - a day</p>
<p>with you is a day I must endure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For tomorrow I wake to my alarm</p>
<p>You're still here - but your weight</p>
<p>Today, I can manage your figure</p>
<p>Reduced to an imp, waking up yourself</p>
<p>And I let you crawl on my shoulders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shower and brush my teeth</p>
<p>You cling to me muttering something</p>
<p>I'm out the door, you perched</p>
<p>On my shoulder - never gone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need you - you're my excuse</p>
<p>Why I don't show up - why I can fail - why I become angry sometimes</p>
<p>And so I wear you another day</p>
<p>And perhaps later I'll feed you</p>
<p>And we shall lay in tangled sheets</p>
<p>I absolutely deserve you - because I feed you</p>
