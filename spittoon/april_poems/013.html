			<p><strong>This Amazing Person</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<img src="../../img/petronas.png" width="400" height="400">

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Who is this amazing person?</p>
<p>Kind wife, kind child, all kindness</p>
<p>Regal enough to be a king &ndash; but mild</p>
<p>Find myself struck with a sudden blindness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s step back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In KL drawing the Petronas twins</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stifling but I finish the linework</p>
<p>Store the drawing for now &ndash; sights to see</p>
<p>The bridge between a must with my architecture quirk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elevator down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what? &ndash; Here to draw a monument</p>
<p>Too hot to color, to shade, without shade</p>
<p>Pull up a map app &ndash; a restaurant nearby</p>
<p>Walk around the block and a lobby I invade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elevator up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opens to one restaurant &ndash; I&rsquo;m underdressed &ndash; or over-sweated</p>
<p>A quick question, a quick point, through there?</p>
<p>A beautiful Steinway, a glorious lounge, a span</p>
<p>A bridge between buildings with a neighbor unfair</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walk across or is it through?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know...</p>
<p>This transitional space holds the power of this building<br /> <br /> I&rsquo;m underdressed for the next restaurant too</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m granted a spot because of my nod to the towers</p>
<p>Or a winning grin &ndash; I don&rsquo;t really know how I found a seat &nbsp;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m here for a reason, and I order gentlemanly</p>
<p>When I pull out my drawing, it&rsquo;s only a little cower</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friends with the staff immediately</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eight markers on the table... mostly repetition</p>
<p>Mezcal with my server... towers have a new perspective</p>
<p>And so I draw.&nbsp; New perspective doesn&rsquo;t mean new details</p>
<p>Allowed to sprawl across this table and go introspective</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finish my drawing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank my hosts and pay my bill... the work is done</p>
<p>Gather everything... overtip, quiet my mind, I&rsquo;m welcome, I&rsquo;m kind</p>
<p>And step back into the previous space, the bridge</p>
<p>But a few tequilas deep I really only have one thing in mind</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A grand piano</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask the bartender of the fanciest bridge bar I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>Do you mind if I play the piano in the corner &ndash; I play, I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>Looks me up and down &ndash; <em>Ask the family over there, their choice</em></p>
<p>I approach a trio from a movie, expecting to be spurned&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The warmest smiles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Of course! You play?.. Mind if I send my daughter your way?</em></p>
<p><em>She wants to learn too.&nbsp; Can she watch?&nbsp; </em>I haven&rsquo;t played a note</p>
<p>Of course... I just like to play &ndash; they resume talking... niceties offered?</p>
<p>I play my normal start.. Victor&rsquo;s Solo... allows me to emote</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They seem to forget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the mood for Moonlight Sonata &ndash; clich&eacute; &ndash; appropriate</p>
<p>This piano wishes my fingers across the keys... butter</p>
<p>Its not the most beautiful thing I&rsquo;ve ever done but it&rsquo;s close</p>
<p>And this rhapsody of a family approaches and I begin to stutter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Thank you</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>It seems you&rsquo;re about to go.&nbsp; Can I get you a drink?</em></p>
<p><em>Will you stay and play a few more songs? &nbsp;</em>No clock burning</p>
<p>Umm, Gin? &ndash; <em>Hendricks, cucumber? &ndash; </em>yeah, thank you</p>
<p><em>I already asked, but can my daughter watch &ndash; she&rsquo;s learning?</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Of course, as I re-sit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My eyes are watering and my heart is melting &ndash; clich&eacute;</p>
<p>I dance through some works I am proud I know how to play</p>
<p>Then I fall into a rhythm &ndash; its like I&rsquo;m at home &ndash; no thoughts</p>
<p>Them watching &ndash; no judgement &ndash; nothing to prove or say<br /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He comes over with the warmest of gaits &ndash; daughter in tow</p>
<p><em>What do you say &ndash; Gracias &ndash; No... thank you &ndash; </em>Mexican?</p>
<p><em>We are from Mexico City, si &ndash; </em>Si, I see. He laughs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m struck.</p>
<p>I am gross and dirty &ndash; what are these niceties for this traveling bum?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Can I hug you?</em></p>
<p><em>Before you go?</em></p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve brought us joy and timid kindness for an hour or more or so</em></p>
<p>Uhhh.. yeah of course...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hug</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave the lesser of two bridges spanning buildings this block</p>
<p>Struck by the simple, profound kindness of a family I barely met</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure he knows where I&rsquo;m from, what I do, anything</p>
<p>But this interaction might describe me better than any I have had yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so who is this amazing person?... How many lives has he touched?</p>
<p>The best question he left me wondering &ndash; is did he also view me as such? &nbsp;</p>
