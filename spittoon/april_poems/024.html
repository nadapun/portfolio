<p><br /> i'm skeptical of the cage of poetry...</p>
<p>it tricks me into shoving words up my own ass and becoming a puppet</p>
<p><br /> i'm skeptical of becoming a poet...</p>
<p>i oft don't even really know what words are so just fondle about until i find some connection</p>
<p>to another word or person or idea and then mis-mangle those gems into a story or a message</p>
<p>or a lesson overexplained.. is that all poetry is or perhaps that&rsquo;s just me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a poem when a glance would do</p>
<p>a poem when a sigh is enough</p>
<p>a poem when math and art and music exist</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm a hypocrite...</p>
<p>that needs no extrapolation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am skeptical of poets</p>
<p>diminuendo</p>
<p>&phi;</p>
<p>elif</p>
<p>limiting vocabulary to spoken words</p>
<p>limiting ideas to spoken language</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am skeptical of poetry</p>
<p>chaos and disorder, form and verse and so <em>caged</em> in...</p>
<p>nowhere to go except the human voice and i fold when i read</p>
<p>so this <em>art </em>remains trapped on a page forever silent</p>
<p>at least a cage is 3-D... does my poem think its Trompe-l'&oelig;il</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here i sit writing &ndash; saddened, excited, lost, caged</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m skeptical of poetry...</p>
<p>i could do without it all if it would kindly just leave me with the poems</p>
